# Sound Creation

This project explores sound wave manipulation and visualization using R. The notebook includes creating and modifying audio signals with examples of analyzing sounds from different sources such as cats, dogs, piano, violin, and guitar.

## Contents

This project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Library Imports**  
   Using `tuneR` and `seewave` for audio signal manipulation and analysis.

2. **Working Directory Setup**  
   Automating the working directory configuration using `rstudioapi` to get the active document path.

3. **Audio File Loading**  
   Examples of loading sounds like:
   - `cat_110.wav` (cat)
   - `dog_barking_112.wav` (dog)
   - `10Piano.wav` (piano)
   - `10Violins.wav` (violin)
   - `10Electric_Guitar.wav` (guitar)

4. **Signal Manipulation**  
   Creating and visualizing sinusoidal signals by adjusting frequency, amplitude, and phase shift.

5. **Signal Combination**  
   Overlaying and combining waves to create new signals.

## Requirements

- **R**: Latest version
- **R Packages**: `tuneR`, `seewave`, `rstudioapi`

## Running the Notebook

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/sound-creation.git
   
2. Open the Sound Creation.qmd file in RStudio and run the cells to replicate the experiments.
